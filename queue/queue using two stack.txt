Algorithm to Implement Queue using Two Stacks
Case 1: Enqueue

Whenever enqueue operation is happen, Push element to stack1.

Case 2: Dequeue

i) When both the stacks are empty then throw an error.
ii) When stack2 is empty and stack1 is not empty, push all the elements of stack1 into stack2.
iii) After that pop the element from stack2 and print it.
