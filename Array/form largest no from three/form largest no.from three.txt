Given an array of numbers form 0 to 9 of size N. Your task is to rearrange elements of the array such that after combining all the elements of the array number formed is maximum.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N denoting the number of elements in the array. Then in the next line are N space seperated integers denoting the elements of the array.

Output:
For each test case print a single line a number denoting the largest number that can be achieved by rearranging the elements of the array.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 107
0 <= Ai <= 9

Example:
Input:
2
5
9 0 1 3 0
3
1 2 3

Output:
93100
321
