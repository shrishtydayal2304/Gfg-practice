# problem
Given an array of size N, swap the kth element from beginning with kth element from end.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains 2 lines of input:
The first line contains an integer N, where N is the size of array.
The second line contains N integers(elements of the array) sperated with spaces.

Output:
For each test case, print the modified array.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 500
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:
Input
1
8 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
Output
1 2 6 4 5 3 7 8
