Given a decimal number. Write a program to convert it into equivalent binary number.

Input:
First line of input contains a single integer T which denotes the number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N which represents a decimal value.

Output:
For each test case, print the binary equivalent of the given decimal value N.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= N <= 103

Example:
Input:
3
7
10
33
Output:
111
1010
100001
