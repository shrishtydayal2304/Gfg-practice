Given a string S and two integers L and R. Print the characters in the range L to R of the string.

NOTE: Assume zero based indexing.

Input: 
First line of input contains a single integer T, which denotes the number of testcases. T testcases follows, first line of each testcase contains a string S. Second line consists of two integers L and R.

Output: 
Corresponding to each testcase in new line, print the required output.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= length(S) <= 103
1 <= L <= 800
1 <= R <= 900

Example:
Input:
2
cdbkdub
0 5
sdiblcsdbud
3 7

Output:
cdbkdu
blcsd

Explanation:
Testcase 1: The characters from 0 to 5 of the given string: cdbkdu
